This folder is used for shared components used across all of the screens
- think modules or reusable parts
- each component should have its own file and be exported as default
- the only exception to this is styles.js 
- - styles.js has all of our css rules within one constant. 
- - Each screen imports the styles from styles.js, where it can be used as an object.
