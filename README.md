## About the Project
Through this project, our group has created and implemented a mobile application that serves as a toolkit on safe alcohol consumption practices for our fellow peers. The app provides a hub of information regarding alcohol consumption, safety practices, and general resources. Using user specific demographics and information, the app can also calculate the BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of the user as they input the different drinks they have consumed. 

## How to Build and Deploy Code
- Currently, to run our code on your own laptop, please clone our repository by using the command `git clone`. 
- In your IDE, open a new terminal. To install all of the code packages, type and enter the command `npm install`. 
- To run our app, type and enter the command `npm run web`. This will open our app in your browser via localhost. 
    - To view our app as it would appear on a mobile device, open up Inspector Tools (in Chrome on a Windows laptop, the shortcut is _Ctrl + Shift + I_ or right click and select 'Inspect') and set the screen dimensions to **iPhone SE**.

## About Us
Hello! We're iBant, a group of four Informatics students studying at the University of Washington. Through this Capstone Project, we aim to utilize and reflect our education at the iSchool to produce a product that fills an information gap and creates positive social impact.<img align="right" height="200" src="./assets/avatars/Casual_Rosie.png"> 
<br>
Upon reflecting on our personal and fellow peer's experiences, we decided to create a toolkit to help our fellow students with safe alcohol consumption practices. Overuse of alcohol and abuse that leads to unsafe drinking can be both dangerous in the moment and long term among young adults. Through this, we hope to fill the information gap and address misinformation regarding safe alcohol consumption.
