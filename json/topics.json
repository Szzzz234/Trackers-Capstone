                "answer": "The liver can metabolize **one standard drink an hour**. Factors such as age, weight, gender, personal metabolism, and amount of food eaten also play a role in how fast the body can processes alcohol. A person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is **reduced by 0.015 per hour** or at an average rate of .015 g/100mL/hour. This process cannot be sped up with time, sleep, food, or other methods. *You cannot flush alcohol out of your system once it's in!*",

                "question": "How do I know when I'm drunk?",
                "answer": "The effects of alcohol vary from person to person, and it may take some people a quicker or longer time to start seeing signs of intoxication when drinking the same amount of alcohol. Typically, for **males** with little to no tolerance, they may begin to show some signs of intoxication when their BAC reaches **0.05%**. A **woman** who weighs 150 pounds will reach a BAC of 0.10% after drinking about 4 drinks in an hour. With little or no alcohol tolerance, **general impairment levels** are observed at the following BAC levels: - **0.05%** = detectible; - **0.07%** = driving impaired; - *Note: **0.08%** is the **federal limit** to legally drive in the United States, but you can be impaired and arrested even if your BAC is under 0.08%*; - **0.10%** = intoxicated; - **0.20%** = decreased consciousness; - **0.30%** = unconscious; - **0.40%** = fatal. When a person with BAC levels between 0.10% and 0.20% does not show obvious signs of intoxication, it typically means they've developed a tolerance for alcohol. This means they most likely are regularly drinking heavily and are showing characteristics of dependence.",

                "answer": "**Alcohol by volume (ABV)** is the number of milliliters of ethanol per 100 milliliters (or 3.4 fl.oz.) in a solution. ABV is the most common metric used in the United States. ABV can indicate how you feel after drinking an alcoholic beverage and can also tell you how strong that beverage might taste in terms of alcohol content. ABV is typically calculated using a hydrometer or alcoholmeter. **ABV formula:** ABV = (Final gravity - Original gravity) X 131.25. The drink's **original gravity** is the hydrometer reading before yeast is pitched and the drink's **final gravity** is the hydrometer's reading after the completion of the fermentation process. (There are also calculators available to know the precise ABV metrics of a drink.)",
