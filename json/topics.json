                "answer": "In healthy people, blood circulates through the body in 90 seconds, which means they can begin to feel the effects of alcohol within 15 to 45 minutes after the first drink.",

                "answer": "The liver can metabolize **one standard drink an hour**. Factors such as age, weight, gender, personal metabolism, and amount of food eaten also play a role in how fast the body can processes alcohol. A person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is **reduced by 0.015 per hour** or at an average rate of .015 g/100mL/hour. This process cannot be sped up with time, sleep, food, or other methods. *You cannot flush alcohol out of your system once it's in!*",

                "question": "How do I know when I'm drunk?",
                "answer": "The effects of alcohol vary from person to person, and it may take some people a quicker or longer time to start seeing signs of intoxication when drinking the same amount of alcohol. Typically, for **males** with little to no tolerance, they may begin to show some signs of intoxication when their BAC reaches **0.05%**. A **woman** who weighs 150 pounds will reach a BAC of 0.10% after drinking about 4 drinks in an hour. With little or no alcohol tolerance, **general impairment levels** are observed at the following BAC levels: - **0.05%** = detectible; - **0.07%** = driving impaired; - *Note: **0.08%** is the **federal limit** to legally drive in the United States, but you can be impaired and arrested even if your BAC is under 0.08%*; - **0.10%** = intoxicated; - **0.20%** = decreased consciousness; - **0.30%** = unconscious; - **0.40%** = fatal. When a person with BAC levels between 0.10% and 0.20% does not show obvious signs of intoxication, it typically means they've developed a tolerance for alcohol. This means they most likely are regularly drinking heavily and are showing characteristics of dependence.",
