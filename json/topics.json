ABV can indicate how you feel after drinking an alcoholic beverage and can also tell you how strong that beverage might taste in terms of alcohol content. ABV is typically calculated using a hydrometer or alcoholmeter. **ABV formula:** ABV = (Final gravity - Original gravity) X 131.25. The drink's **original gravity** is the hydrometer reading before yeast is pitched and the drink's **final gravity** is the hydrometer's reading after the completion of the fermentation process.

Set yourself a drinks limit, count your drinks, and stick to your limit; 7. Slow your intake with alcohol-free drinks; 8. Avoid drinking games and shots (binge drinking is dangerous); 9.

Tell a white lie (e.g., 'I'm on a budget and want to save money,' 'I have an appointment early tomorrow morning,' or 'I'm on medication that can't be mixed with alcohol'; 5. Keep a (non-alcoholic) beverage in your hand (making people less likely to offer you a drink); 6.

Check in with yourself (figure out your limits before you go out drinking, and check in with yourself periodically to register how you feel); 6. Be aware of sudden changes in how your body feels (if you feel changes and suspect you or a friend has been drugged, call 911 and inform the healthcare professionals. Tell a friend and have them take you to a safe place); 7. Keep an eye on your friends (if you're going out in a group, plan to arrive together and leave together. Check in with your friends and have them check in on you.); 8. Always have a plan to get home and have a backup plan (keep emergency contacts ready and have multiple options to get home); 9.
